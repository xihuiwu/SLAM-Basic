# SLAM-Basic
This is a basic introduction to <b>Simultaneous Localzation and Mapping</b> (SLAM). The motivation of the writing is to help reader understand SLAM better. Specifically, a completely SLAM solution with <b>Extended Kalman Filter</b> (EKF) will be introduced here. Notice that a complete solution doesn't mean that SLAM problem is solved. There are still many researches going on in the field.
